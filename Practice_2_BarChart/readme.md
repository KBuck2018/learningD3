# Learning D3

### What is it?

D3 stands for data-driven documents, whats cool about it, is that it allows you to bind arbitrary data to a DOM and apply transformations to it.

D3 is not the end all be all, what it does do, is provide a significant solution to a large problem and allows one to use minimal CSS or SVGâ€™s to get it to the home plate.

### Why D3

D3 is great for creating dynamic data graphs, as well as making art through mathematical data

### Things to be aware of

D3 is very opinionated and needs to interact with the DOM, which makes it very hard to interact with Reactjs and needs to use a faux-react-dom
